Crunchy is a generic python-based platform for constructing and executing automated and asynchronous (multi-threaded) processing workflows. 

At its core, crunchy watches input directories for new files or directories that match user-defined patterns and, once their file size is stable (e.g., if data is being copied),
launches custom processing scripts (termed workflows) using a pool of worker threads that facilitate parallelisation.
